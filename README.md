# cssmodules-classnames
Combine classnames with cssmodules

## Why?
This module was created to allow better use of cssmodules and the npm module classnames. It creates a user friendly className from some options that are passed into classnames directly and a CSS module object. By user-friendly I mean each unreadable style generated by cssmodules is paired with a human readable style that can be easily targeted by custom user styling.

## How to use?
You can use this module almost exactly the same as the classnames module, but with an extra argument at the beginning. This argument is a JS object generated by cssmodules.

Example:
```
const classname = require('cssmodules-classnames')

classname(cssmodules[, args passed to classnames])
```
